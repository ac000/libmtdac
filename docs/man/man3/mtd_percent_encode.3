.SH LIBRARY
libmtdac, \f[I]\-lmtdac\f[R]
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]#include <libmtdac/mtd.h>\f[R]
.PP
char *mtd_percent_encode(const char *str, ssize_t len);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function percent encodes the given string.
.TP
\f[B]str\f[R]
A pointer to a buffer containing the string to be encoded.
.TP
\f[B]len\f[R]
The length of the string pointed to by \f[I]str\f[R].
Use \f[B]\-1\f[R] for len to be taken as \f[I]strlen(str)\f[R].
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, a pointer to a dynamically allocated buffer containing the
encoded string, which should be \f[B]free(2)\f[R]\[aq]d when finished
with.
.PP
On error, \f[B]NULL\f[R] is returned.
The only way this fails is if there was insufficient memory to allocate
the new buffer.
